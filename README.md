<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

#### Windows install part A (checked on Windows 10 and 11)

1. Install `scoop`, (a command-line installer for Windows). 
Open a `PowerShell` terminal (as user - NOT admin. The prompt should be your username NOT Windows32) and execute the following commands (one at a time):

   A) Install Scoop
      ```shell
      Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
      ```
   
      WARNING - If it asks you to confirm Y/N at this point you need to restart PowerShell as user NOT administrator.

      ```shell
      Invoke-RestMethod -Uri https://get.scoop.sh | Invoke-Expression
      ```   

   B) Install Git 
      ```shell
      scoop install git
      ```

   C) Install poetry
      ```shell
      scoop install main/poetry
      ```

   D) Uninstall incorrect version of python
      ```shell
      scoop uninstall python
      ```

   E) Install correct python version
      ```shell
      scoop install python@3.11.6
      ```

   F) Install Fluidsynth
   
      ```shell
      scoop bucket add extras
      ```
      
      ```shell
      scoop install extras/fluidsynth
      ```
   G) Add Fluidsynth to PATH  (NB It may have automatically done this.)

      Add the `C:\Users\me\scoop\apps\fluidsynth\current\bin` subdirectory to your PATH (change 'me' to your username) . 
To do this, click in the search box on the task bar, run the command 'Edit the system environment variables', click 'Environment Variables…', select Path in the 'User variables' section, click 'Edit…', click New, then enter the path of the bin subdirectory, e.g. `C:\Users\me\scoop\apps\fluidsynth\current\bin`  (change 'me' to your username) . )

[//]: # (5. Install Fluidsynth installer)

[//]: # (   1. Go to the FluidSynth releases page https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases)

[//]: # (   2. Download the latest 64-bit release for Windows &#40;e.g. fluidsynth-2.1.0-win64.zip&#41;. )

[//]: # (   3. Extract this zip file into some directory, e.g. c:\Users\me\install\fluidsynth. &#40;NB replace 'me' with your username&#41;)

[//]: # (   4. Move the 'bin' folder from 'fluidsynth' into 'install' folder &#40;drag and drop from the folder&#41;. )

[//]: # (   5. Add the `C:\Users\me\scoop\apps\fluidsynth\current\bin` subdirectory to your PATH.
